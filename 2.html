   Their home ground is the <strong>Etihad Stadium</strong>, which they moved to in 2003.
    Since the takeover in 2008 by the Abu Dhabi United Group, the club has experienced immense financial investment and global growth.
    Under manager Pep Guardiola, they have implemented a unique, possession-based, and high-pressing style of play, achieving historic treble wins.
